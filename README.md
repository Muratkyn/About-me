# üí´ About Me:
Hi & Welcome! This is Murat, a frontend engineer in the making. I have been very passionate about web development as I began exploring the possibility of creating beautiful and interactive user interfaces as I needed one for my own projects. As I dived in this tech-world, I have had more courage to become a proficient frontend engineer.<br>

Currently, I'm focusing on learning React and Typescript to build robust and scalable web applications. I find Typescript particularly exciting because of its ability to catch errors at compile-time, resulting in more reliable and maintainable code.<br>

Besides, I have been working on several projects to sharpen my skills in building real-world applications. I believe that working on side projects is a great way to learn and apply new skills.<br>

I do love staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the frontend world. It really fascinates me how the technologies develop so quickly that we need to adapt ourselves to stay up to date, thus I'm always eager to learn more.<br>

Feel free to check out my repositories. Peace out! <br>
